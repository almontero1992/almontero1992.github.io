		<h1>Kelsey's Feeline Beeline</h1>
		<br>
		<p>We’ve been in the St. Louis area since 2000. The first time I 
		took my cat outside in a safe environment I knew I had to share 
		this with all cat families.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Our focus is to make sure your cat gets the
		adventure of a lifetime. The first two sessions will focus on training your 
		cat to be comfortable wearing the harness. Training will take patience and 
		plenty of treats. Not all cats are meant for the harness life, if at the end of the second 
		session it seems like your cat isn’t about adventure that session will be free. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		The younger we train the better!! New kitties are always ready to learn, explore, 
		and earn treats. Having a cat that is food orientated will also help! If you purchase our 
		basic package you’ll get an hour of outdoor time, a half hour of playtime and a guarantee of 
		fresh food and water. Of course your kitty will get a treat for behaving outside.
		</p>
